      <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>My name is Adrian Luley adn I am 25 years old. 
            I currently attend Kenzie Academy, a school for web development in Indianapolis, Indiana. 
            I was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and have lived here since. I have 2 dogs named
        Marley and Gucci</p>
      <h2>The Road So Far</h2>
         <p> So far in the Kenzie Academy I have learned how to manuver thruough Terminal,
             which is a program that helps you dictate what the computer does for you step by step.
             I have created my first web page, you are currently looking at and I am learning how to
             style and code it now. 
         </p>
      <h3>In The Near Future</h3>
         <p>I am looking forward to learning how to write information, style and add behavior
         to a web page and understand the different languages of coding</p>
